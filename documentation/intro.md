## Basic explanation



## Content
It contains several configurations base for appender:
For log4j2
- Tjahzi  which provides a log4j2 appender as well as logback appender.

For logback
- There is also Loki4j project which seems to provide a fine logback appender.

## Other options

You can use promtail to replicate the log, but as a file system detection it opens a container that loads too much the server
The trace of the file increases the network traffic as it needs to detect the fs changes and send it over

Problem:
- The system needs to read an external fs with a time window (15s for instance). If the pod fails during that time, there wonÂ´t be traces

This approach seems cleaner and more versatile as the logging system pushes the content as fast as it generates.
